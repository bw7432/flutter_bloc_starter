# Flutter Bloc / Flutter Files Starter

Flutter Bloc Starter app is a production ready starter template for creating flutter apps using the bloc pattern.
It demonstrates the use of flutter bloc for creating login, sign up, and sign out functionality.

## Flutter Bloc
Use the bloc patter to create flutter apps with a solid design pattern, are easy to work on, and organize code efficently.

## Flutter Files
This plugin (Flutter Files) for Visual Studio code make generating boilerplate bloc code much easier. Flutter Files generated code lives in the "Features" directory in this example. These are you pages.

## What's Inside
- features - pages, state, events, screens
- interceptors - handles adding things like tokens to api calls
- models - data models
- networking - api client for handling GET, Put, Post, etc.
- repositories - handles creating api calls
- responses - processes responses from the api, maps data to models
- router - named routes
